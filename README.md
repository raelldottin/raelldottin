Attempt a non-trival programming project (one that will require more than 1,000 lines of code to solve) by following these rules:
1. Only one level of indentation is allowed per method, thus no if statements in loops or nesting.
1. You’re not allowed to use the keyword else.
1. All primitive types and strings must be wrapped in objects specifically for the use they are put to.
1. Collections are first class, and as such require their own objects.
1. Don't abbreviate names. If names are too long, you are probably doing more than one thing in a method or class — don’t do that.
1. Only one object operator allowed per line, so object.method() is ok, but object.attribute.method() is not.
1. Keep your entities small (packages < 15 objects, classes < 50 lines, methods < 5 lines).
1. No class may have more than two instance variables.
1. You are not allowed to use getters, setters, or access properties directly.

If hate reflects success, perhaps they should lessen their disdain for me. Either amplify my accomplishments or realize that seeking my downfall is also their own undoing.

As a black person, I often feel like I'm under constant scrutiny. Trust becomes a luxury in a world that seems perpetually against me. If my actions seem aggressive, understand that they stem from a relentless battle for my basic right to exist.
